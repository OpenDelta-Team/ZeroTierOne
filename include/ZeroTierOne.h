 * for ages, so a larger MTU should be fine for the forseeable future. This

 * fragments seemed too brittle on slow/crummy links for no benefit.
 *
 * If this does change, also change it in tap.h in the tuntaposx code under
 * mac-tap.
 * 
 * Overhead for a normal frame split into two packets:
 *
 * 1414 = 1444 (typical UDP MTU) - 28 (packet header) - 2 (ethertype)
