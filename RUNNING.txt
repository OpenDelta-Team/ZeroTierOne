Running ZeroTier One from a source build:

-- MacOS

By convention, ZeroTier One will keep its state here on mac:

/Library/Application Support/ZeroTier/One

ZeroTier ships with a kernel extension for its own tap device, which it
stores in the above directory. To install this from source, type:

sudo make -f Makefile.mac install-mac-tap

This will create the ZeroTier One home above if it does not exist and install
the kext there. Note that the kext must be owned by root:wheel. The make
rule for install-mac-tap takes care of that.

Next, simply run the binary. It must be run as root to open the tap device.

sudo ./zerotier-one '/Library/Application Support/ZeroTier/One' &

Type "ifconfig" and look for the new interface, which should be called
"zt0." The strange IPv4 address it has is your "zero4" address. Visit
http://zerotier.net/ to check your connection.

Kill it with something like:

sudo killall zerotier-one

-- Linux

On Linux, the default ZeroTier home is:

/var/lib/zerotier-one

We use the Linux native tap driver, so no special drivers are needed. Just
type:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/zerotier-one
sudo ./zerotier-one /var/lib/zerotier-one &

Type ifconfig and you should see an interface like "zt0." Then try
http://zerotier.net or ping zerotier.net to check your connection.

-- Windows
